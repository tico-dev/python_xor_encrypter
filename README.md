[Py] This program was created for a university project, carried out by a group of five members. Initially, I developed a 'standard encryption' Python code (using the ord and chr functions), so we could all edit and enhance it. Subsequently, we created a key system to make it more difficult to break the encryption.

The file named "raw XOR Python encrypt and decrypt.py" provides a more explicit demonstration of the algorithm.

[C#] One member simplified the code and created a simple yet very practical graphical user interface (https://github.com/luiz-diniz/XorCrypt)
